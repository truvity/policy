{{/*
Telemetry, as OpenTelemetry's OWN environment variables (decision 0006). No
service reads telemetry from its configuration file: the specification
defines these variables, and every language's SDK reads them without being
asked.

NO ENDPOINT MEANS DO NOT EXPORT, and that is done here rather than in every
program: with no endpoint the exporters are set to `none`, so an SDK that
would otherwise default to localhost and retry forever does nothing at all.
That is why no service carries an enable flag or an environment-name switch.

`service.name` is the release and the component, which is stable for the
life of the pod and carries no request, tenant or version in it.
