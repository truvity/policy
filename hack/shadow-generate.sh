# Generate everything the url-shortener's Pkl contract
# (examples/url-shortener/contract) produces, into a directory:
#
#   <dir>/schemas/             JSON Schemas, one document per shape
#   <dir>/charts/<chart>/      each chart's values.schema.json and README.md;
#                              values.yaml too where the defaults are modelled
#   <dir>/ts/contract.zod.ts   TypeScript types and zod schemas
#   <dir>/py/contract_pydantic.py   pydantic v2 models
#   <dir>/docs/reference.md    the Markdown reference
#
#   hack/shadow-generate.sh [dir]     default: examples/url-shortener/contract/generated
#
# SHADOW PHASE (docs/guides/pkl-shadow.md): nothing here is read by a service,
# a chart or a test. The hand-written schemas stay authoritative.
#
# Every generator runs as a PACKAGE of the pinned contracts release, the way a
# consumer runs it; the version is the one the PklProject pins, read from there
# so that it is written once. Go and Kotlin are not generated yet: they come
# from Pkl's official generators (pkl-contracts' hack/codegen.sh), which need a
# further download each, and their types carry none of the constraints, so they
# would add nothing to a comparison of schemas.
